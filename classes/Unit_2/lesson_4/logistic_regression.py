Now think critically, does your prediction make sense given the data? Try plotting the data to see if you can see the prediction visually.
 If you cannot find the correlation visually, you might have to re-evaluate your logistic function. 
An example plot can be seen here, created by one of our data science mentors, 
which compares two different equations for the logistic regression. Which one makes more sense?
